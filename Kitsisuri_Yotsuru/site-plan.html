      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        Welcome to My Site, This site is here to display my work in various creative mediums, such as, music production, writing, and game design. Through the pages on this site you can brows through my creations.

      <h3>Writing</h3>
      <p>
        Fictional writing To me is more about uncovering events of another world then it is about creating said world. When I write "Reincarnation of a Dedicated Loser" I do not feel like im creating the events i write about, instead I feel like Im figuring out what happens. Its almost just as much of a suprise to me as it is to you, what happens in the story.

      <h3>Music</h3>
      <p>
        Music is something I picked up on the side because my friend did it, but it quickl;y became one of my favorite thigns to do. The act of weaving a melody out of nothing and aranging the flow of emotion and beats together to creat an experience for the listener is exilerating.

      <h3>Games</h3>
      <p>
        Game development is the pinacle of creativity, any creative expression you can think of is used in video games. The essence of video game development is genuinely the creation of worlds, as close to ours as possible. The twist coimes when the freedom of expression takes the experience of this world to places that are unatainable otherwise in our current lives.
